# Task-List-App
This is a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a simple to-do list application. The program creates a GUI window with a top bar, a main input, and a listbox to display all the tasks. The user can add tasks to the list by entering them into the input field and clicking the "ADD" button. The task is then added to the listbox and saved to a text file named "tasklist.txt". The user can also delete tasks by selecting a task in the listbox and clicking the "Delete" button. The tasks are stored in a list, and the text file is updated every time a task is added or deleted. The "open_task_file" function opens the text file and reads the existing tasks, if any, into the listbox and the task list.
